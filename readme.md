  # welcome to my web site
  
This is the code for my portfolio website. For many years this website has housed my photography work for clients and people in general to see. 

I've been editing the `index.md`  and `style.css` files a lot lately to accommodate my growing interests in datasci, programming, and visualization in R - hence, pushing to GitHub for version control.

Since 2016 the CMS in use has been [sassolino](https://github.com/pwrstudio/sassolino).

 ## to-do
 
 - preview image size on main index page - make smaller or eliminate?
 - consider linking pictures to separate full archive page
