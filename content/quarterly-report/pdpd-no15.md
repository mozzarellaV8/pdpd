Hi it's Pete. I recently found a 'quarterly report' I wrote sometime in the summer and decided I should maybe take stock of what's been going on now that it's Fall 2017. 

This one might take more of a list format, because there are more things that I forget than I remember. I'll add links where relevant and fill in the list as I remember what's been going on this past year.
