Hi it's Pete.

I make a living taking pictures, and have been doing so the past 6 or 8 years in New York City.  I studied studio art at UCLA, and received my MFA from Yale University.

 [_mozzarella.website_](http://mozzarella.website) is the name of an independent publishing endeavor that I started with friends in 2016. I prefer other cheeses, but the name **_mozz_** felt open enough to accommodate random new interests should they come up. 

My cat Snake and I live/work in Bed-Stuy. When I'm not doing client work or art-type activity in the studio, I enjoy digging for unexpected data and [programming + datavis in R](http://github.com/mozzarellaV8). Why? [So what?](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/why-do-this-4f2adcc646a1)

Encrusting the web, horizontally: [@pdpd.pd](http://instagram.com/pdpd.pd), [github](http://github.com/mozzarellaV8), [linked in](www.linkedin.com/in/petedeevakul), [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:mozzarella), [medium](https://medium.com/@mozzarella). Or, just [e-mail](mailto:hello@pdpd.org) me. Here's a sketch for an organizational taxonomy of projects and general production:

Alternately, my bio from the Spring 2017 issue of Lucky Peach:

<blockquote>Pete was crowned Mr. WHS, the all-male beauty pageant of Whitney High School, despite his current unshaven and, quite frankly, sloppy appearance. During this time, he dated the Class President, who drove them to Prom in her father's Mazda Miata. Previously, he earned a one-day suspension for an incident involving a potato projectile device.</blockquote>
